# OMNIFOOD WEBSITE
See the website in action here: https://bit.ly/3unvdiI

One of my first projects ever. Created it back in 2018 in my first semester of college while doing a course on Udemy.
I created a one-page landing site for a fictitious food delivery company.
An extensive front-end project created completely from scratch which uses HTML & CSS only without using any CSS framework like Bootstrap or Material UI
